# Brazil e-commerce data analytics with dbt

In this project we will use the brazil e-commerce (bce) dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

>**Context**
>
>This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners(www.olist.com). After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments. The dataset provides information about e-commerce orders in the years 2016-2018. 
>
>**Attention**
>- An order might have multiple items.
>- Each item might be fulfilled by a distinct seller.
>- All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.

The project follows the for the modern data stack more common ELT approch instead of ETL. All the data from kaggle will be loaded into **Redshift** a data warehouse. 
Afterwards the data will be transformed and new models will be build with **dbt**. In dbt it is also possible to include tests and documentation. After transforming the data and building data marts, the data marts can be analysed with BI tools like **Power BI**, which I will use to create dashboards.


## Extract
For this project the data got extracted/downloaded from the kaggle website. The data was already split in 9 different csv files.

## Load
The CSV files from the Kaggle project were loaded into a S3 bucket.
![bce_s3_bucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63445819/222436537-3ce9752a-f2be-4fb4-82a7-a18f1ab765bb.png)

Afterwards I created in Redshift one table for each csv file and copied the raw data from the S3 bucket into Redshift. The image below shows the COPY command for the customers data from the customer.csv file into the Redshift table brazil_ecommerce.customers
```
copy brazil_ecommerce.customers from 's3://brazil-ecommerce/olist_customers.csv' 
iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::placeholder:role/placeholder'
CSV
IGNOREHEADER 1;
```

The time data (calendar) which is needed for time anaylses is loaded directly as a CSV file into the dbt seed folder. 
More information under the topic Transform-Seeds.

## Transform (dbt)
Using the ELT approach the transformation of the data starts after loading the data into the data warehouse (Redshift).

### Project structure & Datamodel

**Attention:** For this project I use the free dbt-Cloud version, which allows us to only manage one project. 
Because I'm also using dbt-Cloud for the dbt-training project "jaffle_shop", we have two projects combined in this one dbt-project structure. 
The two projects are seperated from each other by using different subfolders in our models and unified prefixes (bec) for the SQL files (image below, left)

Dbt-Cloud also allows us only to connect to one database in AWS Redshift. Therefore we have a similiar structure in Redshift as well. The raw data for both projects (brazil_ecommerce, jaffle_shop) and the from dbt created models are stored in different schemas in the same database "analytics" (image below, right).

![dbt_and_redshift_structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63445819/222439077-4c4aef58-7acb-4fc2-9df6-2e415ea451b8.png)

The dbt structure with the different layers and functionalities will be explained in the next parts. In each layer (staging, intermediate, marts) exists YAML files and SQL files. The YAML files are used for configuration, we can specify descriptions for models and columns or add generic tests. The SQL files contain the code which will be compiled and run by dbt in our data warehouse, to transform the data and create views/tables/CTEs.

The folder structure of the project should reflect the data flow. It starts with a wide variety of source-conformed models and transforms them into fewer, richer business-conformed models. This can be dimensional models with a star/snowflake schema or wide tables for different business topics.

### Staging

The goal of the staging layer is to access the raw data of Redshift, select the necessary columns and process light transformations like changing column names, generating new columns by concatenating information. A best practise is to use consistent pattern of file names. After the "bec" prefix all staging models continue with a "stg" prefix. Another best practice by dbt is to use for each raw data table one seperate staging model SQL-file.

The staging folder contains the two YAML files sources and staging. The sources YAML-file configures which data from Redshift will be accessed. The image below shows the bec_sources.yml file. The name of the source is "src_brazil_ecommerce" and will be needed in the SQL-files. As well I add a short description, the referenced database and the schema in the database. For each table in Redshift I also added tests for specific columns.

![sources_yaml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63445819/222470756-1aef0b42-6500-47be-90b8-81a9e5044e06.png)

The staging.yml file is similiar and contains the configuration for each staging-model file, with the name and also generic tests.

Each staging models is organized with two CTEs. One for pulling the data from the specified sources (sources.yml) with the source() macro and one to process the transformation. In the exampe below we use the CTE source to pull the data from the source table payment of the previously defined source "src_brazil_ecommerce". Afterwards we transform the data in the CTE bec_payments to generate a surrogate key by concatenating two columns. The transformed data will be materialized as a view in Redshift. The materialization of the models can be specified for each model layer in the dbt_project.yml file.

```
with source as (

    select * from {{ source('src_brazil_ecommerce', 'payments')}}
),

bec_payments as (

    select 
        -- concat for creating surrogate key
        concat(order_id, cast(payment_sequential as varchar(2))) as payment_id,
        order_id,
        payment_sequential,
        payment_type,
        payment_installments,
        payment_value as amount

    from source
)

select * from bec_payments
```

### Intermediate 

In the intermediate layer are SQL-files with more complex transformations then in the staging layer. The layer will be often used for transformations like pivoting, aggregation or joining. We have two intermediate modules in this project, which use the prefix "int" in their filenames. For example, the file bec_int_payments.sql pivot the different payments for one order and aggregates the grain of the different payments for each payment_type as well as the total amount per order.

```
{% set payment_methods = ['credit_card', 'voucher', 'not_defined', 'boleto', 'debit_card'] %}
 

with payments as (

   select * from {{ ref('bec_stg_payments') }}
),

aggregate_payments_to_order_grain as (

    select
        order_id,
        {% for payment_method in payment_methods -%}
            sum(
                case
                    when payment_type = '{{ payment_method }}' 
                    then amount
                    end
            ) as {{ payment_method }}_amount,
        {%- endfor %}

        sum(amount) as order_total_amount
    
    from payments

    group by order_id
)

select * from aggregate_payments_to_order_grain
```

The image below shows the difference between the tables created by the payments staging model (top) and the pivoted intermediate model (bottom)

![int_payment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63445819/222537089-ed279900-66e3-4dd8-aa39-a95ecf748b2d.png)


### Marts

The data marts are the part where all comes together and they are the tables which will be accessed and analyzed by the business user with their BI-Tools like Power BI, Tableau or SQL Querys. The marts represents concepts or entities of the business, for example users, customers or stores, as well as business events like orders or payments.

The marts can be organized as dimensional models (star schema) with dimensions and facts as well as multiple wide tables. The dimensional model is easy to understand commnly known and use less duplicated data than wide tables. For this project we will use the dimensional model approach, because we only use a small dataset and the focus is on education.

But in the modern data warehousing where storage is cheap and compute is more expensive, it is a good approach to use wide tables. This is a denormalized approach, because there is one wide table for each entity/concept. The same data like customer_id will be stored in multiple wide tables which increase the storage. On the otherhand it is not necessary to use joins like in the star schema which reduce the compute costs. I will use wide tables in the football_analytics project.

The data marts normaly contains joins of different tables and aggregations. There souldnÂ´t be any complex business transformations in this layer. The data marts are materialized in Redshift as tables.

#### Dimensions

Dimensions provides the describing informations around business process events. They tell you questions like:
Who placed the order? What product was ordered? Where does the customer/seller lives. When was the order placed?
This project has five different dimensions: customers, products, sellers, locations and calendar.

#### Facts

Facts are the measurements that result from a business process event and are almost always numeric. This could be payment amount or the delivery time. We use four fact tables in this project. This tables also contain the keys from the dimension tables as foreign key to build the relationship between the tables.

	- orders: Order amount, delivery status, different timestamps, delivery in time (y/n)
	- order_items: Metrics for the different items of an order like the price or freight value.
	- payments: amount for each payment sequencial, payment type.
	- reviews: review score for a order, review date, answer date.

### dbt DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) / Lineage

Dbt provides a view how the data moves through the organization/project. 
>If you use a transformation tool such as dbt that automatically infers relationships between data sources and models, a DAG automatically populates to show you the lineage that exists for your data transformations. Your DAG is used to visually show upstream dependencies, the nodes that must come before a current model, and downstream relationships, the work that is impacted by the current model. DAGs are also directionalâthey show a defined flow of movement and form non-cyclical loops. Ultimately, DAGs are an effective way to see relationships between data sources, models, and dashboards.

The following image shows the DAG of the dimension products. The dimension model joins two staging models.

![dag_dim_products](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63445819/222547430-462be1f6-0fc1-447c-a6f3-45d3d32f909a.png)

### Seeds

Seeds are CSV files in the dbt project (typically in your seeds directory), that dbt can load into the data warehouse. Seeds can be referenced in downstream models the same way as referencing other models by using the ref() function. Because these CSV files are located in the dbt repository, they are version controlled and code reviewable. Seeds are best suited to static data which changes infrequently.

In this project we use dbt seeds for the time data of the calender dimension. As well as the models also the seeds folder contains a YAML file for the configuration of the seed files. The following code and image shows the staging model "bec_stg_calender" which references the calendarcsv file in the seeds folder instead of a table from Redshift.

```
with calendar as (

    select 
        *,
        extract(year from date) as year_num,
        concat(daynumofweek::varchar, dayname) as day_num_and_name
    from {{ ref('calendar')}}
)

select * from calendar
```

### Tests
>- **Generic Tests** are written in YAML and return the number of records that do not meet your assertions. These are run on specific columns in a model. The standard package provides the generic tests: unique, not_null, accepted_values and relationships. The tests unique and not_null for example can be used to test primary keys.

In this project we specified generic tests for the source data in Redhift as well as the staging model. For the staging model "bec_stg_orders" are unique and not null tests for the primary key specified. Also a relationship test for the values in the colmun customer_id is specified. This test checks if all values (foreign keys) in the column "customer_id" of the table "bec_stg_orders" also exists in the column in the origin table "bec_stg_customers".

```
  - name: bec_stg_orders
    columns:
      - name: order_id
        tests:
        - unique
        - not_null
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - relationships:
              to: ref('stg_bec_customers')
              field: customer_id
```

>- **Singular Tests** are specific queries that you run against your models. These are run on the entire model. These types of tests are user defined tests for specific attributes that needs to be validatet. For example the total amount of an order can not be negative. These type of tests are not specified in the YML file, they are saved as a SQL file in the tests order of the dbt-project.
